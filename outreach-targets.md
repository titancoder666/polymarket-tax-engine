## 🎯 Outreach Strategy Notes

### Best Channels to Reach These People:
1. **Reddit DMs** — For Reddit users (Tiers 1-2), direct message is the easiest path
2. **Polymarket Discord** — Many leaderboard traders are active here: https://discord.gg/Polymarket
3. **On-chain messaging** — For unnamed wallet addresses, you could use services like Blockscan Chat
4. **r/Polymarket posts** — Create a helpful post about Polymarket tax implications to attract inbound leads
5. **r/CryptoTax posts** — Post a guide specifically about prediction market taxes

### Key Pain Points to Address:
- **"Is Polymarket income gambling or capital gains?"** — Biggest confusion point
- **"How do I report USDC→shares→USDC transactions?"** — Every trade is potentially taxable
- **"I used a VPN from the US — does that affect my taxes?"** — Legal gray area concern
- **"Polymarket doesn't issue 1099s"** — No tax forms = confusion
- **"I have hundreds/thousands of trades"** — Transaction volume makes manual reporting impossible
- **"How do I calculate cost basis for prediction market shares?"** — Unique to this asset class

### Volume → Tax Complexity Matrix:
- **$1M-$10M volume**: Moderate complexity, hundreds of trades
- **$10M-$50M volume**: High complexity, likely thousands of trades
- **$50M+ volume**: Enterprise-level, probably needs professional CPA + crypto tax software
- **Any profit over $600**: IRS reporting threshold for gambling/crypto

### Subreddits to Monitor:
- r/Polymarket (1,475 members)
- r/Polymarket_Traders (78 members)
- r/polymarket_bets (2,665 members)
- r/CryptoTax (18,846 members)
- r/PredictionsMarkets
